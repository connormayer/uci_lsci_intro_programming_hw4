It was the best of times , it was the worst of times .
There is no exquisite beauty without some strangeness in the proportion .
We tell ourselves stories in order to live .
Make it a rule never to give a child a book you would not read yourself .
The sky above the port was the color of television , tuned to a dead channel .
