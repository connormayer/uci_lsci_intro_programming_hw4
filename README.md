The fourth homework assignment from LSCI 109: Introduction to Programming for Language Science

This homework consists of 2 problems, one in each of the following Python scripts:
* score_unigrams.py
* get_mean_valence.py

Each Python script has some code that you will need to fill in. Descriptions of 
each problem can be found in comments in the scripts.

Instructions for how to submit your assignment can be found in the Lab 2 handout.

The tests folder contains the tests that will be used to grade your assignment. 
Do not modify these tests (your assignment will be flagged in the system if
you do), but feel free to look at them.

If you want to run the tests locally, you can run `pytest` from the terminal.
